My name is Joshua Lowe, a current games programming student at Abertay University. I enjoy working in any area that is new to me and presents interesting problems to solve, with lower level software  being my current area of interest. To view my portfolio [click here](portfolio/).
### My Skillsets

I have experience with a variety of tools and skillsets, including:
- Libraries such as LLVM, OpenGL, DirectX, SFML, .Net and SYCL
- Game engines including Unity 5 and 6, Unreal Engine 5, and Abertay's custom Skateboard engine
- Languages like C++, C# and Python
- Using low level APIs like the Windows API to directly manage rendering and bluetooth connections
- Debugging tools like Nvidia Nsight and Renderdoc
- Experience with linux (Arch btw)
- Source control through github for almost all my projects
- Team work with project management solutions like Jira 
- IDEs like Visual Studio and VS Code

I have worked in teams of 2-8 for projects with a variety of scales, from 6 months of full development with artists and designers to weekend game jams with just 2 programmers. Playing to the skillsets of each team member and making sure everyone gets something out of each project is always a fun challenge. 

Outside of my work I have built customer service skills and experience with international time zone and cultural differences through my time working as a rocket league coach, both freelancing and with the team 'Evolve Riot' in the esports scene.
