The wiimote project is a windows app made in C++ designed to manage a bluetooth connection with a nintendo wii remote and use the data recieved from it to emulate keyboard and mouse inputs. This is to this day one of my favourite things that I have ever made, and through this project I learned so much about programming, low level APIs, how connections between devices are managed and how to search through large codebases.

One of the major challenges I faced early on in this project was simply learning how bluetooth functioned and how to even connect to the wiimote. I found out that dolphin emulator, a large open source nintendo device emulation project, supported the wii and was written in C++, and decided to try to have a look at it's code. At the time I was still inexperience and had never seen a codebase so large, but getting in touch with the original creator of the wiimote code was incredibly helpful and was a lesson in communication that sticks with me to this day. After spending so long looking over code and finding nothing, he was able to quickly point me to what I needed and give me an easy to understand explaination of how it worked and why it worked that way.

I cannot overstate how much I was able to learn from my time spent on this project. It was my first experience with searching through massive codebases, asking strangers for help, independant research, low level programming and APIs, and even concepts like endianness in binary data. From this project I feel I was able to take away so much not just about being a better programmer, but a better individual worker and communicator as well.
