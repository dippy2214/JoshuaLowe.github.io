In this project I created a checkers AI for my gameplay AI module in my university course. This AI uses a monte carlo search tree to calculate a game of checkers, with some additional weightings for favouring captures and advancing (designed to make it more capable in the early and end game respectively). During this project I was testing very satisfying small and simple changes to create dramatic improvements in performance, while keeping consideration for the skill level of my AI and how players would interact with it (and potential ways to tweak and control difficulty).

The final product was an AI which plays in a simplified checkers game (no multi-captures) with a front end made in Unity. An early learning curve of this project, and one of my biggest learning experiences, was separating the data from the UI. 

On my first attempt, I didn't consider the AI at all until after I created the checkers game, and created a game where the UI and data were so entangled I ended up restarting with a new outlook. After that valuable lesson, this project went much smoother. It certainly taught me that I need to consider and plan for every part of my game! (the issues came from trying to create multiple boards on the backend which all tried to interact with the same UI, for those who are curious. I recommend the devlog on github to see more).

The development of the rest of this project was extremely interesting and went quite smoothly. I made sure to test a lot for difficulty, and the final product played a good early game and a weaker end game, making it very fun to defeat and giving the player the feeling of the comeback. I am very happy with this project, and while there is always more I could do I feel I achieved all my goals here.
