FNAF Bros Brawl was created with a 4 person team for the PS5, using abertay's in house skateboard engine and C++ for a second year module. My work on this project focused around the camera system and audio, while also doing some odd jobs and debugging and even making some modifications to the engine to get everything working perfectly. Effective communication with team members really aided this project, and I think the team's strength is a core reason as to why this project was strong enough be used as an example project by the uni for future years.

The team who worked on this project included me and three other programmers. Knowing our limitations, we immediately drifted towards a platform fighter game as something that would be more programming heavy with less of an art and design burden. Another core strategy to our teamwork was an emphasis on task ownership early on in the project for major systems like camera, attacks and the character controller. Each large job had an owner, before each person transitioned towards odd jobs and polish in the later stages of the project.

Individually working on the camera system early on presented many interesting challenges. The engine had little beyond the most basic functionality built in (I even had to add the ability to change scenes myself), so working on the algorithm to maintain a view of all players on screen while moving smoothly while everyone was moving around was very engaging and while I am unable to share the full code for this project due to Sony's secrecy with the PS5 dev kits, snippets for this algorithm are visible on github in the devlog.

Group members worked together to manage loads and keep everyone on track, and when one of us was starting to take too long or overcomplicate a task other group members made sure to check in and keep work progressing at a good rate. This was my first experience with group work and an incredibly positive one, and I had an amazing time working on this project.
