      My name is Joshua Lowe, a software developer and student at Abertay University. I enjoy solving new and novel problems with code and am always open to exploring new areas or problem spaces. Making games was my gateway into programming, starting by making chess in my computer science class in high school, and I really enjoy the visual representation of my work that the medium creates.

 After some experimentation in my first year of university with a program to read inputs from wii remotes, something I kept tinkering with on and off through to third year, I realised I like programming interesting or weird software almost as much as games. I especially enjoy working on a lower level to understand the tools I use, which set a theme for me in my personal work. Through university I could satisfy the higher level interest in actually making games, and in my own time I could make on personal projects to understand how the tools I use function under the hood. This journey includes a software rasteriser, c++ library (and linking it properly), making a basic compiler with LLVM and more.

 Outside of university and my own programming work/ tinkering I currently enjoy climbing as a social outlet and sport of choice, chess or catan as a fun board game option to flex my competitive side and building lego to spark my creativity.
